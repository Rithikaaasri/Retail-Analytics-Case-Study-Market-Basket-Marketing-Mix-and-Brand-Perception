# 🛒 Retail Analytics Case Study  

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores how analytics can be used to solve real retail challenges. Using **Market Basket Analysis**, **Marketing Mix Modeling**, and **Brand Perception Mapping**, the study looks at customer purchase behavior, marketing effectiveness, and brand positioning. The focus is on turning raw data into practical strategies that improve sales, marketing ROI, and competitive advantage.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Find out which products customers tend to buy together and design better bundles.  
- Evaluate marketing channels to understand which ones generate the best returns.  
- Compare how customers view different brands and identify gaps in positioning.  

## 🛠️ Approach & Tools  
- **Market Basket Analysis** → Apriori algorithm for product associations.  
- **Marketing Mix Modeling** → Linear and regularized regressions, Bayesian Ridge, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
- **Brand Perception Mapping** → PCA and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).  
- **Tools Used** → Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook.  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- High-value bundles like **Bedding Sets, Makeup Kits, and Full Outfits** offer ~$2.5M cross-sell potential.  
- **Radio and Social Media** emerged as top-performing marketing channels, while TV was least efficient.  
- **PrimeCart** is strongly associated with trust and quality, whereas **ValueMart** competes only on price.  

## 🚀 Business Impact (Projected)  
- **Revenue Growth**: +18–25% ($18–25M annually).  
- **Marketing ROI**: +12–15% improvement through budget reallocation.  
- **Cross-Sell Ratio**: Increase from 18.9% → 30%.
